# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Webflow JavaScript starter project where JavaScript/TypeScript is authored and managed separately from HTML/CSS (which remain in Webflow). Scripts are not bundled into a single file - each script is loaded individually per page as needed, with only `src/entry.ts` (built as `entry.js`) loaded globally. The system uses esbuild for building and serves scripts from either localhost during development or jsDelivr CDN in production.

**Think carefully and only action the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible.**

## Key Architecture Concepts

### Script Loading System
- **Entry Point**: `src/entry.ts` is the main entry file that sets up the global script loading system
- **Dynamic Loading**: Use `window.loadScript()` function to load scripts dynamically (replaces the old `window.JS_SCRIPTS` approach)
- **Environment Switching**: Scripts can be served from localhost (`local` mode) or CDN (`cdn` mode) using `window.setScriptMode()`
- **CDN Integration**: Production scripts are served via jsDelivr CDN from GitHub releases

### Build System 
- **Build Tool**: Uses esbuild with custom build script at `bin/build.js`
- **File Processing**: Processes files defined in the `files` array in `bin/build.js`
- **Output Directories**: 
  - Development: `./dist/dev` (served locally, excluded from Git)
  - Production: `./dist/prod` (committed to Git, served via CDN)

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Path Aliases**: Uses TypeScript path mapping for clean imports:
  - `$components/*` → `src/components/*`
  - `$utils/*` → `src/utils/*` 
  - `$types/*` → `src/types/*`
  - `$dev/*` → `src/dev/*`
- **Global Types**: All global variables, types, and browser extensions are defined in `src/types/global.d.ts`
- **Type Priority**: Always use types from `global.d.ts` before importing from external libraries
- **DOM Extensions**: Extends `ParentNode` for type-safe `querySelector`/`querySelectorAll` returning `HTMLElement`

## Development Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
bun run dev
# or: pnpm run dev / npm run dev
```
Starts esbuild development server on http://localhost:3000 with hot reloading.

### Build for Production
```bash
bun run build  
# or: pnpm run build / npm run build
```
Generates minified production files in `./dist/prod` folder.

### Environment Switching (Browser Console)
```javascript
// Switch to localhost serving (when dev server is running)
window.setScriptMode('local');

// Switch to CDN serving
window.setScriptMode('cdn');

// Enable debug mode
window.setDebugMode(true);
```

## Coding Standards & Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constant variables, placed at the top of the file
- **Files/Folders**: Use kebab-case for files and folders
- **Page Scripts**: Named after the page (e.g., `home.ts`)
- **Data Attributes**: Always use `data-el="{{contextual value}}"` for selecting HTML elements instead of class names
  - For specialized modules, use custom data attributes (e.g., `data-marquee-el="component"`)

### Code Quality Rules
- **No jQuery**: Never use jQuery, even if Webflow loads it - use vanilla TypeScript and modern browser APIs
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully using `console.error` for errors and `console.debug` for debug logs (never `console.log`)
- **Performance**: Prioritize modern browser APIs (e.g., use `IntersectionObserver` instead of scroll event listeners)
- **Modularity**: Avoid global side effects; keep logic scoped to the relevant module or component
- **Comments**: Minimize code comments; code should be self-explanatory and modular

### Animation & Libraries
- **GSAP**: Prefer GSAP for all animations, use ScrollTrigger for scroll-based effects
- **Finsweet TS Utils**: Use for Webflow-related utilities
- **External Libraries**: Only import if native browser APIs are insufficient

## File Structure & Patterns

### Source Organization
- `src/entry.ts` - Global entry point, contains only logic needed for all pages
- `src/global.ts` - Global utilities and Webflow integration
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components/modules
- `src/pages/` - Page-specific scripts (loaded per page as needed)
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
- `src/dev/` - Development utilities (debug, environment switching)
- `src/types/global.d.ts` - All global types and browser extensions

### Script Loading Pattern
Always use `window.loadScript()` for dynamic script loading:

```javascript
// Load a script from the repo
window.loadScript('global.js');

// Load external library with options
window.loadScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/library@1.0.0/dist/index.js', {
  placement: 'head',
  scriptName: 'library-name'
});

// Listen for script load events
document.addEventListener('scriptLoaded:library-name', (e) => {
  // Script loaded successfully
});
```

## Deployment Process

1. **Development**: Work locally with `bun run dev` serving from localhost
2. **Build**: Run `bun run build` to generate production files
3. **Deploy**: Merge to `main` branch triggers GitHub Actions that:
   - Creates semver tag (patch by default, use `#major` or `#minor` in commit message for higher bumps)
   - Makes scripts available via jsDelivr CDN
4. **CDN**: Scripts are served from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/igniteagency/{{repo}}/dist/prod/`

## Development Guidelines

### Debugging & Logging
- Use `console.debug()` instead of `console.log()` for debug logs
- Debugging features (e.g., GSAP markers) should be toggled via `window.IS_DEBUG_MODE`
- Console logs should use styles from `src/dev/console-styles.ts` for clarity
- Environment switching between local and CDN managed via `window.setScriptMode` and `window.SCRIPTS_ENV`

### Formatting & Linting
- Uses Prettier for code formatting (trailing commas, single quotes, 2-space tabs, 100-char print width)
- Uses `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` for import order: third-party, `$`-prefixed, then relative imports
- ESLint present but not strictly enforced; no testing frameworks used

## Important Notes

- Repository must remain **public** for jsDelivr CDN access
- Update repository name in README.md and `src/entry.ts` after forking
- jsDelivr caches tagged versions for 12 hours
- The `entry.js` file must be included in Webflow's `<head>` section first
- Scripts are loaded as IIFE by default
- Never handle user data or sensitive information in this codebase
- Do not use batch script loading; always use `window.loadScript` for dynamic loading
- **For any library dependency related information, do confirm the fact by doing a web search on the respective documentation instead of making a guess**

## Git Workflow

- Keep commit messages concise while mentioning changes and details
- Use semantic versioning tags for releases (`#major`, `#minor` for version bumps)
- Main branch deployments trigger automatic CDN updates via GitHub Actions

## Dependencies

- **Runtime**: Bun (preferred), PNPM, or NPM
- **Build**: esbuild with TypeScript support
- **Libraries**: GSAP (globally available from CDN), Finsweet TypeScript utilities
- **Linting**: ESLint with Finsweet config, Prettier
